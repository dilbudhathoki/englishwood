<h3>MY CHILDHOOD</h3>
<img src="images/dil2.jpg" class="img-rounded" width="250"align="left" vspace="5" hspace="5">

			As a child I spent very carefree and careless life in the rural village, working in fields, rearing animals, going to the jungles for wood and grass, grazing oxen and almost all the typical pastoral activities; so I love the rural life, rather I have good attachment, obsession of the time. I know the life of Poverty too, because my father had 9 children as an Indian soldier, though I was loved and last child and lucky to get education than all others.
The moment of life with no anxieties of future and away from technology, enjoyed playing in the jungles in hunting, bee chasing, wasp firing, swimming too much and fishing in the rivers. Moreover playing handmade cloths ball as volleyball and football can be ridiculous to some people which I enjoyed too.
Sometimes walking to a long distance without money, spending rent life as students are some memories.
Walking to two/three days while going to India and walking upto Pokhara from home is still an interesting memory for me which the modern people can’t imagine.
With lots of primitive life ranging from using grinding stone to watermill, reading in oillamp to surprisement to find the light with switch; and many more rural and scarcitylife has been born by me and now as a person who dares to have his own website.
After Bachelor’s degree as I pursued my life as Arts student, I began to develop ways to looking at the life. I was very innocent at the beginning, learnt types of life, for one thing I never thought to live in Kathmandu but look I have been sursuing my career here, so sometimes life seems to depend upon destiny- just go on doing the duty, life itself will settle you.
I am kind by nature, truth is my virtue and duty is my favorite job. I am almost anytime ready to help anyone to help in need.I am just a humble with ever ready to learn new thin, I would also like to say myself a fearless person but most of the time fail to reply verbally in the form of tit for tat.
I learnt the way of life very lately the ways of developing attitudes and ways living and behaving by the latter part of teaching learning career. Now I believe I am enjoying a beautiful life.
Life is nothing but a way of management and making happy and stress less in your survival.
I easily believe in people because I think they are good. Bad people also become good to me, sometimes that happened to me and I become glad.
I want to enjoy my job and family. Perhaps I am not much ambitious and don’t bear any new mission.
